For many of the resources and other content defined in this specification, mappings are provided to other standards. These mappings are informative and are provided to help implementers of this specification understand the content and use it correctly.

Due to wide variation in the implementation of standards in healthcare, none of the mappings are authoritative or normative, and implementers always have to check local usage before using these mappings in production.

This table summarizes the mappings that may be provided through the specification:
