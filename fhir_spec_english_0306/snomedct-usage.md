This page summarizes the use of SNOMED CT in the base FHIR Specification. It is used by HL7 and IHTSDO to help with SNOMED CT licensing management.

In principle, this base FHIR Specification only uses concepts defined in the International distribution of SNOMED CT, while FHIR implementation guides that use SNOMED CT are generally published by HL7 Affiliates under agreements with National distribution centers. However, there are some US specific codes on this page; HL7 is working with IHTSDO towards remove these from the specification (hopefully they will be elevated to the international SNOMED CT distribution).

#### Concept References

The value sets that reference SNOMED CT explicitly reference the following SNOMED CT concepts. The table lists the concepts, and then the value sets and places they are used from, and includes the binding strengths. The table does not include codes published in the expansions.
