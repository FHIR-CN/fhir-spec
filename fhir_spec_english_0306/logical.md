A logical model is an expression of a set of content in a FHIR ready style that helps implementers understand the content in a single package. Because of the way FHIR works, a single logical model may be actually represented during exchange by a set of resources, including a series of observations and questionnaires. Typically, profiles that define how the resources are used are derived from the logical model.

ToDo: figure out how all this happens.
