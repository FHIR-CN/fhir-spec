**Specification Downloads**
FHIR Definitions
All the value sets, profiles, etc. defined as part of the FHIR specification, and the included implementation guides:
-   [XML](definitions.xml.zip)
-   [JSON](definitions.json.zip)
-   [Forge](definitions-r2.xml.zip): Special version of definitions for [Forge](https://simplifier.net/Forge) (temporary)

This is the master set of definitions that should be the first choice whenever generating any implementation artifacts. All the other forms below include only subsets of the information available in these definition files, and do not contain all of the rules about what makes resources valid. Implementers will still need to be familiar with the content of the specification and with any [profiles that apply to the resources](profiling.html) in order to make a conformant implementation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

XML
-   [Examples](examples.zip) - all the example resources in XML format
-   [Validation Schemas](fhir-all-xsd.zip) (includes support schemas, resource schemas, modular & combined schemas, and Schematrons)
-   [Code Generation Schemas](fhir-codegen-xsd.zip) (see [notes about code-generation schemas](xml.html#schema-gen))
    *Note that names relevant for code generation, including resource names, element & slice names, codes, etc. may collide with reserved words in the relevant target language, and code generators will need to handle this*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

JSON
-   [Examples](examples-json.zip) - all the example resources in JSON format
-   [JSON Schema](fhir.schema.json.zip) (Needs JSON Schema v1.6)
-   [Examples](examples-ndjson.zip) - all the example resources in [ND-JSON format](nd-json.html) (bulk data format)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

RDF
-   [Turtle Examples](examples-ttl.zip) - all the example resources in Turtle format
-   [ShEx Schemas](fhir.schema.shex.zip) - [ShEx](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/ShEx) definitions for validating RDF resources
-   [Definitions](fhir.rdf.ttl.zip) - the formal definitions that define the predicates and classes used in the RDF format (not up to date)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

FHIR Specification
The whole specification so that you can host your own local copy (does not include the downloads) (not downloadable from build.fhir.org)
**Implementation Tools**
Validator
The [official FHIR validator](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=ca.uhn.hapi.fhir&a=org.hl7.fhir.validation.cli&v=LATEST&e=jar) - a Java jar file that can be used to validate resources. See [Validation Tools](validation.html) for further information, or [Using the FHIR Validator](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Using+the+FHIR+Validator) for parameter documentation
IG Publisher
The [Implementation Guide Publishing Tool](org.hl7.fhir.igpublisher.jar) (see [IG Publishing documentation](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/IG+Publisher+Documentation))
NPM Package
The [NPM Package used by many of the FHIR tools](package.tgz) (particularly the IG publisher and the validator). This contains all the conformance & example resources, and various publishing support files. Note that the tools usually find this package directly, and there's no need to download it
Translation File
[Translations of common FHIR names and messages](translations.xml) into multiple languages (see [chat.fhir.org translations stream](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/10-translations) for guidance on how to add to more)
Icon Pack
The [FHIR Icon at various resolutions](icon-pack.zip). Any FHIR Implementation created by an organization that has attended a connectathon is allowed to use the FHIR icon in association with the application (this policy will be reviewed in the future).
Test Cases
Test cases can mainly be found in the [org.hl7.fhir.core](https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/tree/master/org.hl7.fhir.r4/src/main/resources) repository
Code Generation Support
ValueSet expansions for the value sets used in schema generation ([XML](expansions.xml) or [JSON](expansions.json)) + a list of all [choice elements](choice-elements.json) & [backbone elements](backbone-elements.json). Note that names relevant for code generation, including resource names, element & slice names, codes, etc. may collide with reserved words in the relevant target language, and code generators will need to handle this
**Reference Implementations**<span id="refimpl"></span>
There are many open source reference implementations available to help implementers. Here are a list of the more common implementations used by implementers:
Java
[HAPI-FHIR](http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/): Object Models, Parsers, Client + Server Framework, FHIR Validator, & Utilities. The specification is built with this Java code
C\#
[HL7.FHIR](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Hl7.Fhir): Object models, Parsers/Serializers, Utilities, and a Client. Source code on GitHub at <http://github.com/ewoutkramer/fhir-net-api>
Pascal
[FhirServer](http://github.com/grahamegrieve/fhirserver): Object models, Parsers/Serializers, Validator, Utilities, Client, and the FHIR Reference server. Requires [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) (Unicode versions)
XML
[XML Tools](fhir-%3C%version%%3E-XMLTools-0.01.zip): Document Rendering Stylesheet, supplementary implementation schemas and transforms
Javascript
See the [HL7 wiki for Javascript libraries](https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=35718838#OpenSourceImplementations-Javascript) (Clients and Utilities for both servers and clients)
Swift
[Swift-FHIR](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/Swift-FHIR): Object Model, Client and Utilities
\[%impl-note%\] These reference implementations are provided for implementer interest and assistance. While they may be used (and are) in production systems, HL7 and their various contributors accept no liability for their use. <span style="color: Maroon">Note that these reference implementations are provided to assist to implementers to adopt the specification, and some are maintained by the FHIR project team, but are not part of the specification, and implementations are not required to conform to these, nor are they subject to the formal standards process.</span> \[%end-note%\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Full blown open source implementations for FHIR, some of which use these reference implementations, are listed on [HL7 Confluence](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Open+Source+Implementations).

It is not necessary to use these particular implementations in order to be conformant. Any other approach may be used, including code generated from the schemas.
