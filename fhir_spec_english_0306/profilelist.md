This specification is a common platform standard that must be [adapted to particular use cases](profiling.html). Some particular use cases are common or important enough to be described as a part of the specification itself. These are published as groups of [Structure Definitions](structuredefinition.html) (profiles or extensions), which are often found in implementation guides, along with [Value Sets](valueset.html), newly defined [search parameters](searchparameter.html) and examples that are all defined with a common purpose. Additional profiles and extensions may be registered on the HL7 FHIR registry at <http://registry.fhir.org>
