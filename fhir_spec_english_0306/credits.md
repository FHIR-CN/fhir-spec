### Community

The FHIR community meets as part of the wider [HL7 community](http://hl7.org) and draws on its extensive human resources, institutional memory, previous standards and corporate support. HL7 itself owns FHIR and makes it [freely available](license.html) and the community relies on HL7-provided infrastructure.

The FHIR community gathers, meets, or communicates using the following infrastructure, provided by HL7 directly, or by the [HL7 FHIR Foundation](http://fhir.org):

-   <http://chat.fhir.org> - IM based FHIR support forum
-   the [FHIR issue tracker](http://hl7.org/fhir-issues) for task management
-   <http://community.fhir.org> - general FHIR support forum
-   the [FHIR email list](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Mailing+List+Instructions) for general FHIR standards business
-   [HL7 Confluence](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR): for recording informal documentation in support of the community
-   and [GitHub](http://github.com/hl7/fhir) for source control

In addition, the community holds regular face to face connectathons and meetings as part of the [HL7 Working Group meetings](http://www.hl7.org/events/workgroupmeetings.cfm?ref=nav). The formal governance arrangements that manage FHIR development are documented on HL7's [Confluence site](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Governance+Process).
