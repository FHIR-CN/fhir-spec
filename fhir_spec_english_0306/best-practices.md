The base FHIR specification is used across the world in many different contexts, with a great variety of use cases. There are many existing restrictions from common practice and regulation that constrain the agreements that the specification represents. In particular there are large amounts of existing data in legacy record stores that need to be represented and exchanged using FHIR resources.

The requirements analysis that occurs during the design of the FHIR process often leads to a clear understanding of how information should be represented, but also can make clear that for a variety of reasons, such best practices cannot be imposed as standards requirements in all contexts. However, it is useful for the FHIR standard to be able to document what are known best practices.

Committees can document best practice by one of two different ways:

-   defining invariants and marking them as best practice rules
-   adding narrative that defines best practices

When using the [FHIR validator](validation.html), implementers are able to ask for best practice rules to be enforced if they wish.

This page indexes the best practices documented in this specification:
