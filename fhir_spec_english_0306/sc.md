This is an internal QA page. The intent of this table is to help reviewers compare the mappings between the general resource status codes and the status codes on particular resources.

Note: This page is not proscriptive; it's descriptive and comparative, to assist with review. The FHIR methodology says that if two domains use different terms for the same concept (e.g. 'withdrawn' and 'cancelled') then the domain concept name should be used. Conversely, where there is no explicit reason for the codes to differ based on domain usage, they should not.

All status codes must be mapped to one of the general status codes, which are found in the [Resource Status](codesystem-resource-status.html) code system.

Note: **Bold** indicates that the element is marked as a modifier.
