This is an automatically generated list of all the structural differences between FHIR DSTU3 and this version. The following possible changes are checked when preparing this list (and others throughout the specification):

-   Addition or deletion of elements, or name change to elements
-   Changes to minimum and maximum cardinality
-   Changes to allowed types
-   Changes to bindings for Extensible/Required bindings, and changes to codes if it's a required binding on a code element
-   Changes to the is-modifier status of an element
-   Changes to the default value for an element (default values were removed after Release 3, but changes are noted for Release 3 to Release 4)

This analysis only considers changes to data types and resources. Comparison of extensions, profiles and value sets will be added in a future version.

See also the [version transforms](r3maps.html) and the note about [version specific extensions](versions.html#extensions).

This analysis is available as [XML](fhir.diff.xml) or [JSON](fhir.diff.json).
